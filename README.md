# SupermarketList-Web-App - 4th semester - College Project
This is a web Application, that I created during the 4th semester in college, the Web app List of supermarket products was created with the objective of helping users to save money, and organise their shopping items using images.

I used "Glitch.com" as the editor to create this application.

The programming languages used here are:

Javascript
Json
Handlebars
Semantic Ui 
HTML
CSS


  

#Guidelines
First you need to Sign in before Log in, There is basic authentication for the Sign in process, once you signed in, so you will not be allowed to precced without a profile image. 


#Features:
it allows you to add a supermarket list
allows you to add products to the list, delete and update it, as to add an Image for each product
Usefull Information: I decided to locate the add image functionality in the add product page, once it makes more sense for my app, because the users will upload photos of their items / products.

#Knowing bugs

the total price is not considering the quantity of products, it is just adding the price for one product
I would like to add the code if quantity field > 0, multiply tprice (data) for quantity(data). I didnt get it working .
-I got the List With most items to output the title (name of the market list), but once there was no lists, it gave me the error "cannot recognize title" So I commented out those lines (start.js) //listMostProducts:listMostProducts.title, //listMostProducts:listMostProducts.title,

I tried to to the same to output the supermarket name, and it gave me the same error "name is unrecognized", when there was no lists there. ( to solve this problem I tried to add an if statement ( no sucessfull), and a Try and catch error, even a helper), so I deleted the codes and I gave up hopefully I will get some half marks to have tried this functionality
